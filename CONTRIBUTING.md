## Fixes and features

If you wish to contribute with fixes or features here are the guidelines:

* __Make sure there is an issue__ that describes you contribution. So in short, your work starts be creating an issue, not by hacking the code.
* __When you'r done, deliver one ONE commit__ _One_ issue is solved by _one_ commit. It may be a natural work process for you, to have created multiple commits that accumulates the final result. But you will have to `squash` or  `cherry-pick` so that the branch you deliver contains only one commit.
* __Use the phlow__ Developers with write access to the repo us [the phlow](http://www.praqma.com/stories/a-pragmatic-workflow/). An automated process that supports a release train branching strategy.
* __Or use pull requests__ I you don't have write access to the repo, create a fork, prepare your contribution there, and make a pull requests.
